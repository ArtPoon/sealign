SeALign (pronounced "sea-lion" - cute logo pending) is an attempt to port Andrew Rambaut's Se-Al alignment editor to HTML5 Canvas and Javascript.

[Se-Al](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/seal/) is a fantastic piece of software.  I use it constantly for inspecting and editing sequence alignments.  However, it depends on libraries that are no longer supported in current versions of Mac OS-X.  This is one of the major reasons why I've had to put off upgrading my system.  A while ago I complained to Andrew about this and he proposed collaborating to port Se-Al to Cocoa.  However, I contributed absolutely nil to this project (much to my chagrin) and as far as I know it hasn't moved forward.

I think it's possible to reproduce the functionality of Se-Al as a web application, specifically using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript (jQuery because I'm lazy) to implement the graphical interface.  I'm going to have a crack at it.  Any help would be greatly appreciated - I'm more of a Python programmer these days and not very strong with Web languages.
